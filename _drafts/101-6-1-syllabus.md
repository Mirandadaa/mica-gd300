## Course Description
Students actively engage motion graphics as strategic medium for experimentation, idea generation, problem solving and communication. Motion and interactivity are studied in the context of aesthetic, cultural, historical and critical issues. Students learn essential design processes and techniques in their exploration of time-based media both as a tool and as a medium for evolving designers. *Prerequisite: GD 220 (Graphic Design 2)*.

## Supplies

### Required Textbooks
- Understanding Comics

There is no required textbook for this course. For any required readings, I will either give you printouts or links.

### Suggested Textbooks
- 

### Technologies
- Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro)


## Expectations
- You are required to bring every handout, file and other course materials to every class meeting. Failure to bring in the supplies that are needed to work in class will result in a whole letter grade reduction for the project.
- Backup your files to external hard drives and cloud-based services. No excuses for losing your files no matter what. Again, *back up your files at all time*. Three backups are recommended - local machine, external hard drive and cloud.
- All cell phones must be silenced or turned off, and are not allowed to use during class. No Facebook, instant messaging or irrelevant web surfing allowed.
- Computers must be turned off or in ‘sleep’ mode during critiques and lectures; students caught messaging, browsing, typing, or otherwise being distracted by the computer during critiques and lectures will be given one warning and then asked to leave.
- Critiques include yielding constructive feedback to your peers based on aesthetic, conceptual and technical aspects of their work. Students are required to participate in this process, but should be sensitive to the ego and understanding of their peers.
- During demos, remember that students learn at varying rates. Please be patient.



## Attendance
Attendance and participation is mandatory. Arrive on time to the start of each class and after each break. Failure to return from break will be considered as absence. Do not leave class early before it is completely dismissed. *Students who have the equivalent of more than 3 absences are no longer eligible to earn credit for the course.* If you are absent, it is your responsibility for gathering any material missed. I will not recap.

Only a *serious* medical issue or family *emergency* situation with a proof of written documentations will be excused.

Tardiness is also not tolerated. If you arrive 10 minutes past the scheduled class start time or after returning from break,  this is considered tardy. *3 tardies will be counted as an absence. Arriving more than 30 minutes late will be marked as an absence.*


## Grading
*The assignments and projects are subject to change.*

1. Project 1:
2. Project 2: 
3. Project 3: 
4. Project 4: 

A detailed description for each assignment will be given in class. The final grades will be based on all four projects above + attendance records.

On any assignment:

A — You demonstrate an advanced understanding of concepts presented and are able to complete work above and beyond suggested parameters.

B — You exhibit a more than competent understanding of concepts presented and utilizes these concepts in an articulate and noteworthy manner.

C — You demonstrate an a basic understanding of the information studied and apply this information to assigned problems meeting basic expectations but not going beyond suggested parameters.

D — You exhibit limited understanding of the concepts and complete work below the level required for satisfactory performance.

F — You demonstrate little or no understanding of course material, shown little desire or motivation to complete the work or turn in incomplete projects.

All projects are due at the beginning of class. Work handed in more than 15 minutes a er the beginning of class is marked late. For each missed class session, its final grade will decrease by a whole letter. After three missed class sessions, the project receives a failing grade and is no longer accepted. No work will be accepted after the final class. There is no late work submission for the final project.

Please feel free to use our o ce hours to set up a meeting if you have any issues. Do not wait until the last minute.


## Assessment
Your work in this class will be assessed based on the following criteria: Product, Process and Professionalism. I will provide you with a midterm assessment of your work to date and a final grade which takes into account all the projects of the semester.

## MICA’s Academic Policy statements 

### Americans with Disabilities Act 
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Learning Resource Center at 410-225-2416, in Bunting 458, to establish eligibility and coordinate reasonable accommodations. 

### Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) 
It is the responsibility of faculty and students to follow health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA's Emergency Action Plan and attend EHS training. It is each faculty member's responsibility to coordinate with the EHS Office to ensure that all risks associated with their class activities are identified and to assure that their respective classroom procedures mirror the EHS and Academic Department Guidelines. Each of these policies and procedures must be followed by all students and faculty. Most importantly, faculty are to act in accordance with all safety compliance, state and federal, as employees of this college and are expected to act as examples of how to create art in a way to minimize risk, and reduce harm to themselves and the environment. Faculty must identify and require appropriate personal protective equipment for each art making process, for each student, in all of their classes, when applicable. Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection are in place 

### Plagiarism 
Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work. 

### Policy 
MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else's ideas or work without proper acknowledgement. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another's work, paraphrase another's ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the student's department. In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all of the instructors of the courses involved. 

### Consequences 
When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or program director. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the department chair or program director may then report the student to the appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties, including expulsion. 

### Appeal Process 
Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue. Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a letter of appeal to the department chairperson or program director, or relevant dean or provost related to the course for which actions were taken. The academic officer will assign three members of the relevant department/division to serve on a review panel. The panel will meet with the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant and available materials. The panel will determine whether or not to confirm the charge and penalties. The findings of the panel are final. The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, division, the student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any recommendations for change in penalties. 

### Title IX Accommodation 
Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an environment based on mutual respect that is free of bias, discrimination and harassment. If you have encountered sexual harassment/misconduct/assault we encourage you to report this. Disclosures made to faculty must be reported to the Title IX Coordinator, Title IX Deputy Coordinator, or Title IX Specialist. Disclosures made by students in course assignments are not exempt from mandatory reporting. If you require academic accommodations due to an incident involving sexual harassment or discrimination, please contact Student Affairs at 410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363. 

### Students with Extended Illness or Cause for Legitimate Absence 
In the case of extended illness or other legitimate absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs so that instructors can be notified. Graduate students must contact the instructor, program director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in art education or professional studies programs must contact the Dean for the Center for Art Education or the Dean of the School for Professional and Continuing Studies, respectively. The appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory academic progress.
