## File naming conventions
In any animation project, you will be dealing with multiple softwares, file formats and files. Being able to quickly find the file you need and move between the current and previous versions is an essential skill. Good organization skill will also help working as a team. More often than not, your design project will involve many people working at the same time.

Let’s say you are working on an endtag for a Starbucks TV commercial. You may want to name your file like this:

```
STA_endtag_160901_v01.mov
```

You come back after lunch break, and make a few changes. Then the updated file will be:

```
STA_endtag_160901_v02.mov
```

A couple things to notice in this example is that you always start naming your files with a project name(in this case, STA). There is no space between each word, and you version up every time you make a big change.

If you are working on a collaborative project, then you want to include your name. If your name is John Doe:

```
STA_endtag_jd_160901_v02.mov
```

*Versioning up* instead of overwriting is important. Sometimes, bad things happen(it really does), and your file can get corrupted. If that file is the only thing you have, you have to start all over again from scratch. But if you have multiple versions of the same file, you can at least go back to the previous version, which will save you a ton of time. Do not rely on your memory. Keep the name *short and be descriptive*.  

*Tip: Never name your file with the word ‘final’. You never know if you will need another change. And if you do, you will have 5 different ‘final’ files, which is very confusing. Instead, version up with numbers, for example, v05, v06, ...*




## Folder Structure
When you start a new project, create a folder with the project name (in above case, STA) and save everything in the folder. Within the main project folder, create subfolders.

A number of folders to use will depend on each project, but keep a clean structure that you can understand.

## After Effects Project Management
After Effects project file (*.aep) contains a lot of different files that are linked from different folders and places. And it can quickly get messy. First time you create a new project file, make it a habit to create folders in project tab as shown below.

## Back up strategies
I strongly suggest that you keep at least three different copies of your project.

### local machine
This will be inside the computer that you work with. It gives you the latest copies of everything you have and will be the fastest method of retrieving the files. You can lose everything if your machine breaks down or get stolen. That's why you need an external backup.

### external storage
If you use Mac, Timemachine is one of the best ways to keep regular backups without you manually having to do anything. But, the external hard drive can crash or you may lose your thumb drive. That's why you need a cloud backup on a remote location.

### Cloud backup
Use Dropbox, Google Drive or something similar. Use something that will sync with your computer automatically.
