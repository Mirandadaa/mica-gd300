> Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible.
>--- Paul Klee

> A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.
>--- Stanley Kubrick

> Since ancient times artists have longed to create with moving lights a music for the eye comparable to the effects of sound for the ear.
>--- Dr. William Moritz

> ... Let us compare the screen on which a film unfolds with the canvas of a painting. The painting invites the spectator to contemplation; before it the spectator can abandon himself to his associations. Before the movie frame he cannot do so. No sooner has his eye grasped a scene than it is already changed. It cannot be arrested. Duhamel, who detests the film and knows nothing of its significance, though something of its structure, notes this circumstance as follows: “I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images.” The spectator’s process of association in view of these images is indeed interrupted by their constant, sudden change. This constitutes the shock effect of the film, which, like all shocks, should be cushioned by heightened presence of mind. ...

We will practice creating various types of movements and the spatial/temporal rhythms they make. Choose a short audio/music clip that has no spoken words and strongly communicates moods and/or emotions. Pay attention to how the sound (and what it conveys) is structured and think about how to interpret it into visuals and motions. How would you translate musical elements such as a beat, melody, tempo, harmony, timbre, etc. into visual elements?

For example, different instruments and the layers of sound can be translated into different form elements. How the sound progresses over time can be translated into temporal rhythm. Think about the relationship between sound and visual. It can be amplified or it may fluctuate over time. It may be repeated multiple times. It may be obvious or ambiguous. It may support or contradict each other. There may be a hidden meaning/message behind what we see or hear. 

Use only geometric shapes and do not use any figurative shapes such as real world objects, characters, etc. Focus on movements, spatial & temporal progressions, rhythmic expressions and compositions. Express the spatial and temporal rhythms that are unique to time-based media.

Additionally, think about how you can use all the design elements in this context - contrast, scale, form, texture, direction, hierarchy, value, balance, repetition, color, etc. Do you feel that the use of these elements are limited or can be expanded?




## Objectives
- Learn and practice technical skills that are necessary for creating motion graphics.
- Explore principles and characteristics that are unique to time-based media such as timing and spacing.
- Explore ways to tell a story under given constraints.
- Review the fundamental design principles in a new context.
- The relationship between the sound and the visual.
- Develop a working process that is efficient and flexible.




## Steps
1. Find a short audio clip (15-40 seconds) that has no spoken words. 
2. Choose the one that gives you good visual ideas to work with.
3. Analyze its musical structure. Identify elements that can traslate into visuals.
4. Create sketches to explore different forms, colors, compositions, etc.
5. Create a styleframe, or a single image that can communicate your entire piece visually.
6. Create storyboards. The number of boards will depend on your idea - a rough suggestion is 10-20 boards.
7. Create animatics based on storyboards and sync it to the sound.
8. Animate based on the animatics.
9. Get feedbacks on each stage. Iterate & improve.




## Deliverables
- length: 15-40 seconds
- video format: 1280 x 720px (29.97fps)
- Technically, use vector shapes and animate with After Effects. Effects and textures are ok.
- Submit not only *the final video file* but also your *styleframes* and *storyboards*.
