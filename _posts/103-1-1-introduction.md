## Definition

### What is Motion Graphics?

There does not seem to be a clear definition of what motion graphics is (yet). It is also not clear how we can distinguish it from animation, which in many cases, is a term used interchangeably. Animation has been around from the beginning days of film[^first-animation]. The origin of the term, motion graphics, can be traced back to [John Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitney_(animator))'s company, Motion Graphics Inc. in 1960, but the foundation of the field can be found in the early 20th century's experimental animators' work. 

We will not attempt to define what motion graphics is here, instead, we will look at views from different people to have a better understanding of what we will be learning.

In [this video](https://vimeo.com/29732896) produced by [Motion Plus Design](http://motion-plus-design.com), they explain the difference between traditional animation and motion graphics. 

> although this boundary remains blurred, the distinction lies where traditional animated film features a story in which characters express themselves. Motion design can also portray characters, however they do not directly express themselves.

Justin Cone who runs [Motionographer.com](http://motionographer.com) said in [a Stash Magazine article in 2008](https://www.stashmedia.tv/pdfs/coll_MG_booklet_screen.pdf).

> Motion Graphics is a term that can be widely and liberally applied to the changes going on in the fields of design, animation and filmmaking … Motion graphics may be less about its products and more about an attitude, an approach that can only be defined as “motion graphicky.”

### Definition of Animation

[Norman McLaren](https://www.nfb.ca/explore-all-directors/norman-mclaren/) who was a filmmaker as well as a founder of animation department in National Film Board in Canada defined animation in a letter[^sifianos] as below.

> Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn; What happends between each frame is much more important than what exists on each frame; Animation is therefore the art of manipulating the invisible interstices that lie between the frames. 

What's important to note here is that the focus is on movements, not on drawings (or frames). Animation is an illusion. Everything is expressed as static frames. The illusion is created when a series of frames are played at a reasonable speed. You can create amazing animation only using [simple geometric shapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=they7m6YePo) or you can create poor movements out of beautiful forms and compositions. 

Although we could not define what motion graphics is, but I hope that reading and thinking about it will give you some ideas. What is motion graphics to you? This question will lead to another one --- what kind of motion graphic work do you want to create? 

It is useful to think about where you want your work to be in the vast world of motion graphics. Are you wanting to fit into the existing industry and make great work? Do you want to explore an uncharted land of animation that does not fit into any category? Are you interested in more specific area such as bringing your typography work and adding movements, or using animation as a way to communicate your intention in a different way?

No matter how we define it, our goal in the class is quite clear. We will build upon graphic design principles and explore ways to integrate time-based media into our design work. We will have many same criteria as print design work. But animation is not just a static composition dancing around. Instead of putting these two fields side by side, we will explore what is unique to this medium. There are also many territories involving movements that are undefined, especially with the new digital technologies. It will be also exciting to imagine what the field would be like in the future.
