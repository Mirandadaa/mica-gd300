The final project is to create a promotional video.




## Steps
1. Pick an organization or company that you like or support.
1. Research the organization you pick. Talk to people around you. Collect materials.
1. Create a video piece that supports the organization. (ex. their values, identity, activities, products, services, etc.)
1. Choose your own audience group, and contextualize your piece. (ex. TV advertisement, web commercial, logo animation, billboard animation, event promotion, etc.)
1. You can use any technique as long as your piece can be presented as a video. (ex. motion graphics, photo montage, kinetic typography, video interviews, type+image, etc.)
1. Follow the process that we've been using (sketches, storyboards, animatics, iterations) and use the animation techniques we've learned so far.




### Things to think about
- How is time-based design different from print design?
- What are the strengths of the time-based media and how can we use them to communicate our ideas?
- Who will be using your design for what, when and how?
- What kinds of potentials or limitations does it have for different contexts and environments? What approaches to take for the chosen audience group?

The country (and the whole world) is more divided than ever before, but it does not mean we also need to fight against each other. There, I believe, are a lot of things that we agree on and have to protect. Let's take some time to think about the values that are important to all of us, and promote them with hopeful messages. Let's not promote conflict or hatred, but promote understanding, respect and empathy. 

- No name calling, insulting
- Keep positive voice. Do not blame others.
- Let's not build the fear.
- Be respectful to people who may have different opinions.




## Deliverables
- resolution: 1280x720px is suggested but depending on your platforms and contexts, it may change. Please talk to me when you make different decisions.
- frame rate: 29.97fps
- length: 15 seconds - 1 minute; Remember, you only have 5 weeks left.
- file format: Quicktime video (compressed with H.264 video codec)
- there may or may not be audio.
- Submit not only *the final video file* but also your *storyboards*.
