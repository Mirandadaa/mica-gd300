How would the meaning of the text change when it is animated? The movement may simply support what the text says, it may add additional meanings or it may go against the text. Let's explore the relationship between the text and movements. Interpret the text and visualize it through animation with your intentions.

Choose text from a poem, novel, speech, film, etc. (Keep it short.) Choose the one that gives you strong visual ideas - concrete or abstract. If the text does not have a sound such as in a poem, find an audio track and develop a temporal rhythm that goes along with it. If the sound already exists such as in a speech or film, develop interesting movements that works with the rhythm. Sometimes, it is more effective to give some breathing space than fill every moment out with animation.

Animation is a medium that is fairly new to us, but we can still apply all the typographic and compositional elements such as hierarchy, scale, contrast, etc. Do not lose your perspective on the design fundamentals while working with animation.




## Objectives
- The relationship between the text, sound and visual.
- Explore principles and characteristics that are unique to time-based media such as timing, spacing, sequencing and transitions.
- Explore ways to tell a story under given constraints.
- Review the fundamental design principles in a new context.
- Develop a working process that is efficient and flexible.
- Learn and practice technical skills that are necessary for creating motion graphics.



## Steps
1. Research and choose the text/audio you will use.
1. Sketch ideas. Create and collect source materials. Choose the type. Limit the type selection.
1. Create storyboards.
1. Create animatics.
1. Animate. 
1. Iterate on each step and finish.




## Deliverables
- length: 10-30 seconds
- video format: 1280 x 720px at 29.97fps
- Use H.264 video codec.
- Submit not only *the final video file* but also your *storyboards*.
