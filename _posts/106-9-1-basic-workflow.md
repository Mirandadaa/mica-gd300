There is a reason why there are so many steps and processes in animation production. They are for efficiency and communication. I will introduce the basic workflow of a motion graphics project. Note that this is just a guideline and the actual process can be very different for everyone.

## Pre-production
All the planning that takes place before the actual production (or animation) is called the pre-production stage.

### idea
You will either start from your own idea or be given a project brief from your clients. They may have very specific requests and requirements or you might have freedom to develop the ideas. Understanding the brief and coming up with directions to follow is crucial as it will dictate all the production that will happen later.

### mood boards
[Mood boards](http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) are a collection of reference materials (usually, images) that convey your design concepts. You can describe with mood boards what words cannot describe alone. After all, what you have in your head or mind will need to be expressed visually. Mood boards can help your client (and yourself) to visualize your ideas before making commitment to any.

### styleframe
A [styleframe](https://vimeo.com/25724900) is a single image that represents a motion graphics piece, how it will look and how it will feel. The graphics you create for the styleframe may or may not be part of the final piece. 

### storyboarding
Storyboarding is a process of creating still images from the beginning to the ending of a motion graphics piece. The number of boards depend on the length and complexity of the work. Nearly all video productions use storyboarding one way or another to save time in production stage but there a re some difference among different productions such as live action film, character animation and motion graphics. In motion graphics, it is expected that the boards will have the same quality as the final.

### animatics
The boards alone cannot convey the timing of each shot or scene. Animatics is a process of laying down storyboards on timeline. Check out [this](https://vimeo.com/151327502) [example](https://vimeo.com/96559752). For a simple project, most of the editing can be done at this stage.

### audio recording
When there is a voice-over track that animation needs to sync to, the recording may be done earlier in the process. Selection of music tracks can come later in the process as well.




## Production

### animating
Storyboarding, animatics and animating are often times fluid process. Because we mostly work with computers, most of our graphic assets are already created during the storyboarding stage. Then, animation can simply start with laying down the boards on timeline and breaking down the layers and moving objects around.




## Post-production
It is often difficult to separate production from post-production, or pre-production from production. On any given project, there are several people working at the same time on different aspects of the project.

### compositing
Compositing can include color correction, green screen keying, stereoscoping 3d rendering, putting together different render passes and more.

### editing

### final bits

This is just a very brief overview, and as you gain more experience, you will develop your own process that works best for you. Design is an iteratice process. You don't just create one set of boards and move on. You will most likely have to create multiple versions of boards and animation.
