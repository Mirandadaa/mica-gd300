# Illusion of Motion

How is the illusion of motion created? After all, what we are seeing is just a series of still images. But, when they are played at a reasonably fast speed, the illusion is created somewhere between the frames. 

## Persistence of Vision
[Webster dictionary defines persistence of vision](http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/persistence%20of%20vision) as *a visual phenomenon that is responsible for the apparent continuity of rapidly presented discrete images (as in motion pictures or television) consisting essentially of a brief retinal persistence of one image so that it is overlapped by the next and the whole is centrally interpreted as continuous*. Many believes that is why we perceive discrete images, or frames, as continuous motion. Do you remember when you were young, you held a pencil gently with your thumb and index fingers, move your arm up and down and the pencil looked like a rubber?

When a long strip of film is passing behind a lens of a film projector, normally at 24 frames per second, there is a black cover called a *shutter*, which blocks the light from coming out, also at 24 times per second. We don't notice that because the movement of the shutter is very fast and also because of the persistence of vision, which retains the previous image on our eyes while the shutter blocks the light. Without the shutter, everything will look blurry. Look at a wheel of a moving car. We cannot make of its shape because there is no shutter.

## Phi Phenomenon
[The phi phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon) is another reason why we experience the illusion of motion. Keep looking at the black cross in the image below for 10-20 seconds. You will see a green circle moving around.

## Beta Movement
One more theory to look at is the beta movement. Physiologically, there is [a difference](http://mesosyn.com/mental8-14.html) between the phi phenomenon and the beta movement.

Old street signs work the same way and in fact, pixels on a computer screen can be thought of in this way. Take a look at [this kinetic sculpture](https://vimeo.com/90523113).
