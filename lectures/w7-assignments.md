# Week 7 assignments

Finish the Project 2: Animate Sound.  
What you need to bring:
- Your storyboards PDF file - if you storyboards were not complete last time, this is a good chance to revise and make it professional!
- Your video file - render out with H.264 codec. Make sure you test it (Is your video dimension 1280x720 pixels? Does the sound play ok?, etc.) and everything works fine before submitting.
  - Use Media Encoder and choose Social Media > Youtube 720p HD preset.
- Upload all the materials to Google Drive.
