# Week 11 assignments

## Project: Title Sequence
- Choose a book you want to work with. Obviously, you need to have a copy of the book with you so that you can always refer to it when needed. If you don't, go to Decker library or find an electronic version of the book online.
- Create a Google Doc and research:
  - Research on the book's contents. (story, moods, message, etc.)
  - Research on the context of the book (when and where it was written and for what purpose)
  - Research the author: 1-2 paragraphs.
  - Research on people/characters in the book, if any. 
  - Research on any important locations/objects, if any.
  - Write down any important/interesting excerpts from the book.
  - Research on anything else that may help you develop visual style for your animation.
- Visual research:
  - based on your initial text research above, find relevant images and videos.
  - Using the found materials, create 10 collage images that represent the book in different ways.
  - Again, DO NOT use any existing direct visual references to the book.
- Post all the materials on Google Drive before beginning of next class.

*Watch a bunch of title sequence examples - don't just look at the techniques but also the way they tell the story and how the title sequence is related to the main contents.*
