# Exercise: Sticky note flipbook

Flipbook may not look like much when we have all the digital technologies, but it can still be [very powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k31oJu-6gDY). As a first step into the motion and animation, we will create a flipbook with sticky notes.

- Draw frames on sticky notes.
- Record the video of your flipbook. Repeat recording until you get a satisfactory result.
- Sound is not mandatory, but you can include it if you want.
- Crop the video to the square (1:1) format. Find a simple app like [Video Crop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-crop-remove-unwanted-areas/id819074891?mt=8).
- Export the video file and upload onto the Week 1 folder of the Google Drive folder.
- Name the video file with your name.
