# Exercise: Sticky note flipbook

Flipbook may not look like much when we have all the digital technologies, but it can still be a [very powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k31oJu-6gDY) way to communicate. As a first step into the motion and animation, we will create a flipbook with sticky notes.

- The theme of your flipbook is *speed*.
- Before you start drawing on the sticky notes, plan first - what subjects, materials to use, etc.
- Draw all the frames with any materials of your choice. Do some flipping tests to see the motion and timing. The minimum length requirement is *30 frames*.
- Record the video of your flipbook with your phone. Repeat recording until you get a satisfactory result.
- Sound is not mandatory, but you can include it if you want.
- Crop the video to the square (1:1) format. Use a simple app like [Video Crop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-crop-remove-unwanted-areas/id819074891?mt=8) or edit on your laptop.
- Export the video file and upload onto the Week 1 folder of the Google Drive folder. The file extension will likely be *mp4*.
- Name the video file with your name.
