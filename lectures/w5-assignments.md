# Week 5 assignments

## Love & Hate
Choose one motion graphics that you love and another one you hate. Describe what you love or hate about the pieces in a few sentences. Post the text file + the links to each video on Google Drive. Be prepared to discuss with your classmates next week.

## Storyboarding
Based on the feedbacks you got today, create and develop your storyboards. Here is how you should format:
- Set up a letter-sized document **horizontally**.
- On each page, create 6-8 boards. Create more pages as necessary.
- Along with the boards include descriptions for each.
- Include the project name and your name on each page.
- There is no number of boards required; make as many as necessary. You don't need to repeat the boards that are too similar to each other.
- Submit a PDF file.
