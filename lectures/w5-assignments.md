# Week 5 assignments

## Love & Hate
Choose one motion graphics that you love and the other one you hate. Describe what you love or hate about the pieces in a few sentences. Post the text file + the links (i.e. youtube, vimeo) to each video on Google Drive. Be prepared to discuss with your classmates next week. Look at [this post](https://github.com/cdaein/mica-gd300/blob/fall2017/lectures/w1-resources.md) for inspirational websites.


- Read [the new project brief](proj-sound.md) carefully.
- **Pick two audio clips** that you want to work with. We will eventually choose one next week, but **work with 2 different ideas this week**.
- You may sketch/draw while listening to different music to start thinking about how to translate audito to visual.
- Develop your ideas by making **initial sketches**, exploring different forms and movements.
- Once you have enough ideas to pursue, **create a styleframe for each audio clip**. A styleframe is a single image that can communicate your entire piece visually. If you have to explain your animation visually with only one image, what would it look like?
- Post all the materials - audio clips, sketches, styleframes -- on Google Drive Week 4 folder. **Remember, develop ideas/styleframes for two different audio clips.**

## Tips for audio editing
If you need to cut or edit an audio file, you may try these softwares.
- Adobe Audition: multi-track editing software, so you can combine different audio clips if you want.
- [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org): free software. pretty simple to use.
- AE and Premiere can handle audio, but not recommended.



## Storyboarding
Based on the feedbacks you got today, create and develop your storyboards. Here is how you should format:
- Set up a letter-sized document **horizontally**.
- On each page, create 6-8 boards. Create more pages as necessary.
- Along with the boards include descriptions for each.
- Include the project name and your name on each page.
- There is no number of boards required; make as many as necessary. Any important visuals and changes should be addressed in the boards. You don't need to repeat the boards if they are too similar to each other.
- Submit **a PDF file** on Google Drive.
