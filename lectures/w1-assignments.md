- Post your headshot on Google Drive. Change the file name with your name. (ie. firstname_lastname.jpg)
- Install the softwares (Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder and [Storyboarder](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)) Run the softwares at least once to make sure they work.
- Finish the animation exercise, and bring your original drawings as well as the image files. Upload image files on Google Drive before class starts. **You must be ready at the beginning of each class. Anything uploaded or changed after the beginning will be marked late.**
- A note on your images: the images you shot must be sequential (ie. 001.jpg, 002.jpg, 003.jpg or IMG_0431.jpg, IMG_0432.jpg, IMG_0433.jpg) meaning the numbering should increment by one.
