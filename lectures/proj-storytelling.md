# Project”: Storytelling

Pick a pre-existing short story of any genre from newspaper, book, article, essay, etc.

Analyze the story - What is it about? Who are involved? Where is it happening? What is the tone of the story? 

Write the same story in three different versions. In twenty words, eighty words and 200+ words. What are the essential elements of the story? What are the interesting details? What are the things you may add/change/omit?

The same story can be told in many different ways. For example, news media tell the same story in different tones. Traditional stories have many different versions. What do you think is the author's intention and how would you interpret it? Who is your audience?


## Process
1. Pick a story.
1. Read and analyze it.
1. Research on contents - Characters, places, etc. Collect images, texts links and references.
1. Research on visuals - What tone do you want to tell the story in? Create mood boards.
1. Create storyboards to communicate your idea/story visually.
1. Create animatics to get the rough timing.
1. Animate, record audio/video, etc.
1. Get feedback and iterate.
