# Project: Storytelling

Pick a short story of any genre from newspaper, book, article, essay, podcast, etc.

Analyze the story - What is it about? Who are involved? Where is it happening? What is the tone of the story? Is there a [story arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc)?

Write the same story in three different versions. In twenty words, eighty words and 200+ words. What are the essential elements of the story? What are the interesting details? What are the things you may add/change/omit?

The same story can be told in many different ways. For example, news media tell the same story in different tones. What gets included/excluded and *how* it's told can make a big difference. Traditional stories have many different versions. What do you think the author's intention is and What is your interpretation? Who is your audience? What is the context?

Once you have a good understanding of the story and what you want to communicate with it, 


## Process
1. Pick a story.
1. Read and analyze it.
1. Research on contents - Story structure, characters, places, etc. Collect images, texts links and references.
1. Research on visuals - What tone do you want to tell the story in? Create mood boards.
1. Create storyboards to communicate your idea/story visually.
1. Create animatics to get the rough timing.
1. Animate, record audio/video, etc.
1. Get feedback and iterate.
