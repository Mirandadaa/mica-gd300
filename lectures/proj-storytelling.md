# Project: Storytelling

Pick a short story of any genre from newspaper, book, article, essay, etc.

Analyze the story - What is it about? Who are involved? Where is it happening? What is the tone of the story? What is [the structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure) of the story? Is there a [character arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc)?

Turn the original text into 200-words text. You may summarize it or choose an entirely different structure for your text. Turn your text again into 20-words text. What is the most essential information that needs to be included? What are the interesting details? What are the things you may add/change/omit and still communicate?

The same story can be told in many different ways. For example, the news media tell the same story in different tones. A film adaptation of a book is not always the same as the original text. What gets included/excluded and *how* it's told can make a big difference. What do you think the author's intention is and What is your interpretation? How much do you compress or expand from the original story? Who is your audience and what is the context?

Using your texts and other materials and based on your interpretations, you will create a video/animation. There is no limitation on what tools/techniques you may use. Live action videos, collage animation, found footage, stop-motion, vector animation, kinetic typography or combinations of any techniques.



## Process
