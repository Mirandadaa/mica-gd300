How many ways can you come up with that start with the top composition and end with the bottom one?

- download [the AE project template](../files/square-exercise-template.aep), duplicate the basic composition and add your own animation.
- Storyboard as many ideas as you can for 30 minutes.
- Use the rest of the time to animate as many of them as you can in After Effects.
- You can make any changes as long as you don't change the duration (3 sec), and the first frame and last frame (color and size).
- Explore different forms, movements, easings, transitions and effects.
- You can only use the greyscale colors (black, grey, white..).
- Render out everything you create at the end using Media Encoder.
- Upload AE project file and video renders to Google Drive Week 6.
