# Project: Title Sequence

Choose a book and create a title sequence animation for it. DO NOT use any existing references such as book design, movies, illustration, tv shows, performances, other design, etc. that are directly based on the same book. Come up with your own concept and interpretation of the book.

## Deliverables
- Animation file: 1280 x 720px at 30fps.
- Duration: 30 sec - 1 minute
