# Project: Title Sequence

A *film* title sequence is a short segment at the beginning of the film to introduce the title and main casts as well as to establish the tone of the film. For this project, **you will create a title sequence animation for a book**. 

Books do not have any visuals so you will need to create your own visual style using type, images and videos. Do not use books that had already been made into movies such as Harry Potter. DO NOT use any existing references such as book design, movies, illustration, tv shows, performances, other design, etc. that are directly based on the same book. Come up with your own concept and visual interpretation of the book. Think about different methods to introduce the book to the audience and keep them excited about it.

The book does not have to be a novel. It may be an essay, scientific text, etc. BUT, the book's main contents should be text, not images.

Things to consider: author, background, story, moods, locations, characters, objects, dialogue, composition, color, transition, speed, sound, ...

## Requirements
- USE photoss and videos you created.
