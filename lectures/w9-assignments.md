## Visual research - create mood boards
For Project 3: Storytelling, create mood boards. [The Mood boards](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mood+boards&bext=msl&atb=v81-4__&iax=images&ia=images) are a collection of reference materials (usually, images) that convey your design concepts. You can describe with mood boards what words cannot describe alone. After all, what you have in your head or mind will need to be expressed visually. Mood boards can help your client (and yourself) to visualize your ideas before making commitment to any.

- Do you use photos?
- Do you use videos?
- Do you use type?
- Do you use illustration?
- What tone do you want to tell the story in? How can your visual decisions support the tone?
- Find the reference materials that can help communicate your ideas visually and **create mood boards as a PDF file**. As this is about collecting than creating, it shouldn't take too much time. 



## Storyboards
- Create storyboards to communicate your idea/story visually.
- Set your boards in a multi-page PDF file (horizontal orientation). 
- Make sure your boards are HD aspect ratio (16:9).
- Format it professionally!
