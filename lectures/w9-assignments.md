## Visual research
For Project 3: Storytelling, create mood boards. [The Mood boards](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mood+boards&bext=msl&atb=v81-4__&iax=images&ia=images) are a collection of reference materials (usually, images) that convey your design concepts. You can describe with mood boards what words cannot describe alone. After all, what you have in your head or mind will need to be expressed visually. Mood boards can help your client (and yourself) to visualize your ideas before making commitment to any.

- What materials will be used in your piece?
- Do you use photos?
- Do you use videos?
- Do you use type?
- Do you use illustration?
- How do different elements work together on screen?
- What tone/mood do you want to tell the story in? 
- How can your visual decisions support the tone?
- How can your visual decisions help audience unerstand the story?
- Find the reference materials that can help communicate your ideas visually and **create mood boards as a PDF file**. The format of the PDF is up to you.



## Storyboards
- Create storyboards to communicate your idea/story visually. 
- For this first iteration of the storyboards, it may be a rough draft, but the presentation must be professional.
- If you will scan your drawings, take photos under a good lighting condition, and place each board nicely so that we can actually understand what's going on.
- Set your boards in a multi-page PDF file (horizontal orientation).
- Make sure your boards are HD aspect ratio (16:9).
- Format it professionally!
