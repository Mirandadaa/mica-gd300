# Week 6 assignments

1. Revise the storyboards as necessary.
1. Start animating. I suggest you first lay out the storyboard panels in AE and sync to the audio track. In other words, create animatics. And gradually start adding animation based on the timing you set.
1. Post work-in-progress in Google Drive.

## Love & Hate
Choose one motion graphics that you love and the other one you hate. Describe what you love or hate about the pieces in a few sentences. Post the text file + the links (i.e. youtube, vimeo) to each video on Google Drive. Be prepared to discuss with your classmates next week. Look at [this post](w1-resources.md) for inspirational websites.
