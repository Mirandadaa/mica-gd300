# Project 2: Animating Sound

*Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible. — Paul Klee*

*A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what’s behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later. — Stanley Kubrick*
