# Project 2: Animating Sound

*Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible. — Paul Klee*

*A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what’s behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later. — Stanley Kubrick*

We will practice creating various types of movements and the spatial/temporal rhythms they make. Choose a short audio/music clip that has no spoken words and strongly communicates moods and/or emotions. Pay attention to how the sound (and what it conveys) is structured and think about how to interpret it into visuals and motions. How would you translate musical elements such as a beat, melody, tempo, harmony, timbre, etc. into visual elements?

For example, different instruments and the layers of sound can be translated into different form elements. How the sound progresses over time can be translated into temporal rhythm. Think about the relationship between sound and visual. It can be amplified or it may fluctuate over time. It may be repeated multiple times. It may be obvious or ambiguous. It may support or contradict each other. There may be a hidden meaning/message behind what we see or hear.

Use only geometric shapes and do not use any figurative shapes such as real world objects, characters, etc. Focus on movements, spatial & temporal progressions, rhythmic expressions and compositions. Express the spatial and temporal rhythms that are unique to time-based media.

Additionally, think about how you can use all the design elements in this context - contrast, scale, form, texture, direction, hierarchy, value, balance, repetition, color, etc. Do you feel that the use of these elements are limited or can be expanded?
