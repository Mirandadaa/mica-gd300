# How to reposition anchor point precisely?
 
A simple way to reposition your anchor point (or, the axis of rotation) is using the Pan Behind (Anchor Point) tool from the top tool bar.

But this won't allow a very precise control as sometimes you need to move the anchor point to the very center of a shape. In that case, use external scripts.
 
I found two promising ones:
 
- http://aescripts.com/repositionanchorpoint/  - you name the price; if you like the product, it's good to support the creator.
- https://www.batchframe.com/tool/Move-Anchor-Point-3/  - 2 dollars
 
 After you download the file, you just need to follow their instructions. In the case of Reposition Anchor Point script, move the script file as below:

 Now, open After Effects and open the panel by going to Window > RepositionAnchorPoint.jsx.
