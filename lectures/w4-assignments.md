# Week 4 assignments

Before you start working on the Project 2, first, complete the Black Square White Square exercise by rendering at least 3 different variations. Post all the videos you create on Google Drive.

-----

- Read [the new project brief](proj-sound.md) carefully.
- **Pick two audio clips** that you want to work with. We will eventually choose one next week, but **work with 2 different ideas this week**.
- You may sketch/draw while listening to different music to start thinking about how to translate audito to visual.
- Develop your ideas by making **initial sketches**, exploring different forms and movements.
- Once you have enough ideas to pursue, **create a styleframe for each audio clip**. A styleframe is a single image that can communicate your entire piece visually. If you have to explain your animation visually with only one image, what would it look like?
- Post all the materials - audio clips, sketches, styleframes -- on Google Drive Week 4 folder. **Remember, develop ideas/styleframes for two different audio clips.**

## Tips for audio editing
If you need to cut or edit an audio file, you may try these softwares.
- Adobe Audition: multi-track editing software, so you can combine different audio clips if you want.
- [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org): free software. pretty simple to use.
- AE and Premiere can handle audio, but not recommended.
