# Week 4 assignments

- Read [the new project brief](proj-sound.md) carefully.
- Pick **two audio clips** that you want to work with. You may sketch/draw while listening to different music to start thinking about how to translate audito to visual.
- Develop your ideas by making initial sketches, exploring different forms and movements.
- Once you have enough ideas to pursue, create a styleframe.
