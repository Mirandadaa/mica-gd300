# Project 1: Loop

An animated loop is a short animation segement that runs continuously and is repeated endlessly. Some loops have beginnings and endings. Other loops do not. You can enter a loop at any point and leave anytime without missing anything. An endless musical loop is what makes people dancing. When you watch an animation loop, you lose the sense of time --- you can keep watching the same animation over and over again. [The Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_strip) is non-orientable.

For the first project, you will create an animation loop. 

Let's take a look at some examples...

Watch [The Elephant In Wonderland](http://www.jkart.net/anim.html) by Ke Jiang. It is a loop within a loop. The creator says that there are only 24 frames in total in this animation. 24 is an interesting number because it has many factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24). Having many factors means that you can have multiple loops playing at the same time at different speeds. This is a great way of adding variations to your simple animation loop.

[Revolver](https://vimeo.com/11558102) by Jonas Odell et al. is a great example of using secondary actions in a loop. Sometimes, looping the same sequence is not just a repetition but it is necessary to fully illustrate the meanings or intentions.

Adam Beckett's [Sausage City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKS7N5ZzpI8) pushes the idea of an animation loop to another level. When you animate, you are left with the original drawings. But in Beckett's animation, a finished drawings of a loop is resued to create another loop. New drawings and new colors are added through each iteration. The process itself becomes a final result.

[Many optical devices we already looked at](/animation-tools-and-techniques#optical-devices) are based on the idea of a loop as they had a limited space to put frames on. In this day and age, everything is digital and we do not have such limitations, but perhaps, now, we have a different kind of limitation - a short attention span.

[9 Squares Project](http://9-squares.tumblr.com) is a collaborative design project, which shows an interesting juxtaposition of various loops from different designers. Limiting color palettes is not only an aesthetic choice but also a workaround for a technical limitation of a gif format.

I am sure you know a lot of [websites](http://behance.net/rafaelvarona) that feature [animated](http://www.slimjimstudios.com/) gifs.

As many loops contain many smaller or secondary animation, it provides an opportunity for unique storytelling. Typically, animation is considered linear. You start playing and watch until the end and the story unfolds over time. You, as a viewer, are directed to watch animation in a particular order of shots or scenes that a director has set in advance. But in a loop, multiple stories are played at the same time. It is up to you to decide where to start and where to go next. The movement of your eyes will determine how you will experience the story, which may be different every time.


## Animated GIF
GIF image format has been around [for a long time](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3034030/9-design-ideas-that-forever-changed-the-web). It only supports 256 colors. Its compression allows for a small file size, which also means faster download for the user. The advantage of the speed was a crucial factor in the early days, but not so much now. But GIF is still very popular because it can animate! 


## Let's make a loop.
You will come up with a concept and subject for this project. There is no limitations on what tools or techniques or styles you can use. Feel free to explore on your own. It can be stop-motion photography, Photoshop animation, After Effects animation, hand-drawn animation, etc.

Create two loops in the animated GIF format. The two loops must be variations on the same concept. Think about the relationship between them. How will they look when placed side by side? The relationship can be about the subject matter, temporal and spatial rhythms, colors, juxtapositions, etc.
 
An animated GIF is a [very popular](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/fashion/common-on-early-internet-gif-files-make-comeback.html?_r=1&) form of communication. What kinds of forms and contents can it take? What kind of ideas can you convey using loops?


## Objectives
- Learn and practice technical skills that are necessary for creating motion graphics.
- Explore principles and characteristics that are unique to time-based media such as timing and spacing.
- Explore ways to tell a *story* under given constraints.
- Develop a  process for time-based media.


## Deliverables
Create two animated GIF loops. These two loops must be variations of the same concept.

- 2 animated GIF files
- Dimensions: 500 x 500 px per each loop
- Frame rate: 12 fps
- Length: between 60 and 240 frames per each loop

### Boiling effect - for looping animation
is a way to keep things alive.
hand-made feel, more personal
3 frames drawn over previous one
4 or more frames create a sense of direction (unintended)
