# Photoshop Animation

There is [a great course on creating animation with Photoshop](https://www.lynda.com/After-Effects-tutorials/Motion-Graphics-Loops-01-Photoshop-Techniques/483234-2.html) on Lynda.com. It's only about an hour long. You get free access with your MICA email account. So, check it out first.

Here are some tips for animating in Photoshop.

- Animating in Photoshop allows you to use all the brushes and layer features, but it is somewhat limited in what you can do, especially, when it comes to editing.
- When you create a new file, start with one ofThere the Film & Video presets.
- You have two options to choose from in Timeline panel:
    1. Video Timeline
    1. Frame Animation
- With Frame Animation, you create a layer for a new frame, and for each frame, you can turn on or off the layers you need. This is good if you want to do something really simple. If you need a bit more option, use Video Timeline instead.
- With Video Timeline, each layer will become a single frame, meaning, if you want to animate 300 frames, you need to create 300 layers and stack them up in the timeline.
- Before you begin animating, make sure you set the Timeline Frame Rate first - 12 fps will be good for now.
