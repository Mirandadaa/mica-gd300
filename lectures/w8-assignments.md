# Week 8 assignments

1. Read [the project brief](proj-animate-type.md).
1. Choose an audio(or video) with spoken words. You can use Adobe Audition to edit out the audio track. Please be mindful of the audio that can potentially offend others.
1. Transcribe the text/dialog/monologue/etc.
1. Find some references to help you generate ideas(images, other design work, etc.). Optionally, you can create moodboards.
1. Develop visual ideas - compositions, motions, colors, typefaces, transitions and other things that you will need before jumping onto animating.
1. Create storyboards.

*Keep in mind we have 4 weeks to work on this project. It's great that you are challenging yourself with every new project, but please also be realistic with your goals.*

On Google Drive, upload:
- the original sound file
- your transcript text file
