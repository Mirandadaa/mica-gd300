# Working with audio in After Effects

## Preparing the audio file
You can use different audio file formats such as AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, etc. If your audio file is not recognized by AE, try importing it into audio editing softwares such as Adobe Audition and re-export. It fixes the problem often times.

## Import audio into AE
You can treat audio files just like any other files. Simply, import into a project and drop onto the timeline.

## Adding markers
You can add markers for future references to any frame in the timeline.
1. Select a layer and hit `CTRL` + `8`: add a layer marker.
