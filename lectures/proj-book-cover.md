# Project 4: Animated Book Cover Design

Choose a book, in which *time and/or motion* plays a role, and design an animated cover for it. The book can be of any genre, including literature, essay, history, science, etc. Represent *the identity* of the book through your cover design. In addition to paying attention to the principles/elements of graphic design to create a successful book cover design, think about how to integrate *time* as another dimension, and *motion* as another element in your design. Think about what may be now possible to visually communicate.


## Requirements
- Create a functioning and memorable book cover design.
- Do not use the existing book covers and create all the graphic assets yourself (except for image/video source materials).
- You must include the book title, the author's name and the publisher name.
- Your animated book cover must loop. In other words, the first and last frame must connect seamlessly.
- Do not include any sound.


## Deliverables
- 720 x 960 px (vertical orientation) @ 30 fps video file.
- No sound.
- Rendered in H.264 codec
- Length: maximum 15 seconds
