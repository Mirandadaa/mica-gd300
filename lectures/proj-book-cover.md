# Project 4: Animated Book Cover Design

Choose an existing book, in which time and motion plays a big role, and design an animated cover for it. The book can be of any genre, including novel, essay, history, science, etc.


## Requirements
- You must include the book title, the author's name and the publisher name.
- Your animated book cover must loop. In other words, the first and last frame must connect seamlessly.
- You may use type and/or graphics.
- Do not include any sound.


## Deliverables
- 720 x 960 px (vertical orientation) @ 30 fps video file.
- No sound.
- Rendered in H.264 codec
- Length: maximum 20 seconds
