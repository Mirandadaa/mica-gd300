# Week 2 assignments

## Google survey
If you haven't done it yet, please do it this week.

## Project
1. Read the [Project 1 brief](proj-loop.md) carefully.
1. Develop your ideas and make sketches. (Remember that we are interested in the whole process throughout the project.)
1. Refine your ideas and select the one you want to work with.
1. Make 2-4 panels of storyboards for each of your animation idea. This is to plan and organize the ideas so that we will not waste our time while animating, and also for communicating your ideas with the class. Depending on visual styles you will use, the storyboards may be created with pencils, images, illustrations, etc. Make sure the quality of your storyboards is good enough for other people to understand your story. 
1. Everything must be digitized. If your sketches are on paper, take photos or scan.
1. Post all your progress - your images, photo captures, screenshots, digital illustration, etc. to the Google Drive Week 2 folder. 

## Reading
